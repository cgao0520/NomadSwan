NomadSwan v0.1
Author: Vincent (c_gao)

NomadSwan is a WonderSwan( colour) emulator for Nintendo 3DS. This project is mainly based on Oswan v1.7.3 (core code) by toyo and GameYob v0.5 (console and filechooser implementation) by Drenn, most thanks to them. 

The current version (v0.1) is a rough portion and implementation, some games are running on slow speed, specifically the colour games. Fortunately, the compatibility is perfect, since the core code is based on Oswan 1.7.3.

Basic list of features:

- WonderSwan, WonderSwan Color emulation support
- Sound support (not perfect yet)
- Auto SRAM/EEPROM saving and loading

Todo list:
- Save States (coming soon)
- Optimizing the cpu and gpu code for high performance
- Remappable controls
- Custom borders 
- Scale to fill the screen


I shall show my thanks to toyo, Drenn, toshi, Antonio ND and other contributors, without their work or help, this project will not be done.
